        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a full-stack software engineer with experience as a graphic and
          web designer. I've always loved data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m really passionate about disseminating information and resources,
          and empowering individuals and small businesses. If a project utilizes
          data to create impact, I'm in!
        </p>
        <h4>Some fun facts:</h4>
        <h5>
          <i className="material-icons">toys</i>I love languages.
        </h5>
        <p>
          I'm completely fluent in 3 languages: French, Spanish, and English. I
          also speak conversational German and Portuguese, and am currently
          learning Japanese and Dioula.
        </p>
        <h5>
          <i className="material-icons">toys</i>I have a dog named Pixel
        </h5>
        <p>
          ...and she's the best. She's an NYC ACC rescue, secretly a cat, and
          one of the funniest creatures the world has ever met. Ruff said.
        </p>
        <h5>
          <i className="material-icons">toys</i>I like to make art.
        </h5>
        <p>
          I love painting portraits in acrylic and in ink, and I enjoy
          watercolors. I'm starting to get into oil. I also sing, but mostly in
          the shower.
